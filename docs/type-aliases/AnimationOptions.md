[Maptoolkit JS](../README.md) / AnimationOptions

# AnimationOptions

> **AnimationOptions** = `object`

Options common to map movement methods that involve animation, such as [Map#panBy](../classes/Map.md#panby) and
[Map#easeTo](../classes/Map.md#easeto), controlling the duration and easing function of the animation. All properties
are optional.

## Properties

### animate?

> `optional` **animate**: `boolean`

If `false`, no animation will occur.

***

### duration?

> `optional` **duration**: `number`

The animation's duration, measured in milliseconds.

***

### easing()?

> `optional` **easing**: (`_`: `number`) => `number`

A function taking a time in the range 0..1 and returning a number where 0 is
the initial state and 1 is the final state.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type |
| ------ | ------ |
| `_` | `number` |

#### Returns

`number`

***

### essential?

> `optional` **essential**: `boolean`

If `true`, then the animation is considered essential and will not be affected by
[`prefers-reduced-motion`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion).

***

### freezeElevation?

> `optional` **freezeElevation**: `boolean`

Default false. Needed in 3D maps to let the camera stay in a constant
height based on sea-level. After the animation finished the zoom-level will be recalculated in respect of
the distance from the camera to the center-coordinate-altitude.

***

### offset?

> `optional` **offset**: [`PointLike`](PointLike.md)

of the target center relative to real map container center at the end of animation.
